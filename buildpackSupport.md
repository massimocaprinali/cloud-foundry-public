# Buildpack support statement
{: #buildpack_support_statement}

{{site.data.keyword.ibmcf_full}} is deprecated. As of 30 November 2022 new {{site.data.keyword.ibmcf_full}} applications cannot be created and only existing users will be able to deploy applications. End-of-support happens on 1 June 2023. Any instances that still exist on 1 June 2023 will be deleted. For more information, see [the deprecation details](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-deprecation).

## Built-in {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} buildpacks
{: #built-in_ibm_buildpacks}

For [Liberty for Java](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-getting-started-liberty) supports two versions (n & n - 1), for example, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Liberty Buildpack v3.12 & {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Liberty Buildpack v3.11. Each buildpack provides and supports one or more major versions of its corresponding runtime as appropriate. The liberty-for-java buildpack is refreshed once a month.
{: shortdesc}

Problems and issues can be reported against any version of the built-in {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Buildpack that is currently supported on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, but they will be verified against the latest version. If a defect is found, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} will provide a fix in a future level of the runtime and corresponding buildpack. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} will not provide fixes for earlier major and minor versions (N-1, n-1). {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} will not provide support for community runtimes even when using {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} buildpacks, for example, using Open JDK with the Liberty buildpack. These community runtimes follow the same support policy as the built-in community buildpacks, as described in the following section.

## Built-in community buildpacks
{: #built-in_community_buildpacks}

The following built-in community buildpacks are provided by the Cloud Foundry Community:

* Tomcat
* PHP
* Ruby
* Python
* Go
* Node.js
* Dotnet-core

Updates to these buildpacks will be made when {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is upgraded to a new version of Cloud Foundry. Problems or issues with these runtimes on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} can be reported to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, and we will assist in determining if {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is the source of the problem. For issues that are related to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} will provide a fix; however, for defects in the buildpack or runtime itself, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} will assist in reporting them to the appropriate community. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} will not provide fixes for these buildpacks and runtimes.

## External buildpacks
{: #external_buildpacks}

For external buildpacks, support will not be provided by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. You might need to contact the Cloud Foundry Community for support.

## Third-party services
{: #third-party}

The buildpacks enable you to use some third-party services, such as Dynatrace or New Relic, within your apps. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} does not provide support for third-party services. For information about using third-party services in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, see the information about the service you want to use in the latest [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Service terms](https://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/sla/bm){: external}. Before you use a third-party service, also review the licensing information from the service provider.
