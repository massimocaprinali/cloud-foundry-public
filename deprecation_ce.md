{{site.data.keyword.ibmcf_full}} is deprecated. As of 30 November 2022 new {{site.data.keyword.ibmcf_full}} applications cannot be created and only existing users will be able to deploy applications. End-of-support happens on 1 June 2023. Any instances that still exist on 1 June 2023 will be deleted.

{{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull_notm}} excels at delivering a broad set of capabilities for application developers:

* Deploy any kind of container-based workload (webapps, containers, event-driven serverless functions, micro-service, and batch jobs).

* No infrastructure management needed. Cluster sizing, scaling and networking are all automatically managed.

* Auto-scaling of your application based on load, even "scale-to-zero" when idle.

* Subscribing to event producers, such as {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} and Cron.

* Apps are automatically secured with TLS and isolated from other workloads.

* Less expensive in almost all cases (when compared to other IBM Cloud compute options).

* "Push your code" from local disk developer experience.
