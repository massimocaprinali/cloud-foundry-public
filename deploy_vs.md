# Developing with Visual Studio
{: #starter-vs}




1. If you don't already have Visual Studio, install Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio Code by following the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio-2015){: external}.

2. [Download your starter code](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external} and extract it into a folder on your hard disk drive.

3. Open the project in Visual Studio.

    * If you're using Visual Studio 2015, open the `.sln` file by going to **File > Open > Project/Solution**.

    * If you're using Visual Studio Code, open the folder that contains the `.sln` file by going to **File > Open**.

4. After you modify your code, you can redeploy it by using the command line interface (CLI). See [Deploying apps with the Cloud Foundry CLI](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-cf-deploy-cli).
