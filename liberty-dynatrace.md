# Use Dynatrace to monitor Liberty in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #using_dynatrace}

Dynatrace is a third-party service that provides monitoring for your app. You can integrate Dynatrace with your Liberty app, but {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} does not provide support for third-party services. See [Third-party services](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-buildpack_support_statement#third-party) for more information.

For more information about Dynatrace and its licensing, see [Dynatrace Application Monitoring](https://www.dynatrace.com/solutions/application-monitoring/){: external}.

When your Liberty app is configured to use Dynatrace, the default behavior is that the
Liberty runtime will acquire a Dynatrace agent `.jar` file from a Dynatrace site and run
that Dynatrace agent with your app.  With that default behavior the minimal necessary
configuration to use Dynatrace is to create a user-provided service that points to
your Dynatrace collector.

## Creating a user-provided service that points to your Dynatrace collector

First, you'll need to set up a Dynatrace collector.  Then you must create a user-provided
service to pass information for the Dynatrace agent to connect with the Dynatrace collector. See [Dynatrace Architecture](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/display/DOCDT65/Architecture){: external} to better understand the relationship between Dynatrace components.

1. Set up a Dynatrace collector.
    * See the [Dynatrace community website](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/display/EVAL/Step+3+-+Connect+Agent+to+Dynatrace){: external} for instructions on downloading and setting up the Dynatrace collector.
    * Ensure that the collector is set up in a location that is accessible to the Dynatrace agent running with your app in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
2. Create a user-provided service that points to the running Dynatrace collector.

    **Note:** The name of the user-provided service must contain the string `dynatrace`. Case is ignored. For example, use the command that follows, where `my-dynatrace-collector` contains `dynatrace`:

    ```text
    ibmcloud cf cups my-dynatrace-collector -p '{"server":"DynatraceCollectorIPaddress","profile":"Monitoring"}'
    ```
    {: pre}

    In this example, `my-dynatrace-collector` is the name given to the service, `DynatraceCollectorIPaddress` is the IP address of the Dynatrace collector you have configured, and profile is the optional Dynatrace profile name associated with this monitored app. The default profile value is `Monitoring`. You can specify optional options as illustrated in the following example.

    ```text
    ibmcloud cf cups my-dynatrace-collector -p '{"server":"DynatraceCollectorIPaddress","profile":"Monitoring","options" : {"dynatrace-parameterr-1": "value", "dynatrace-parameter-2": "value"}}'
    ```
    {: pre}

    See the [_Agent Settings_ section of Agent Configuration](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/display/DOCDT65/Set+up+Agents){: external} at the Dynatrace community website for more information about available options. For example, by using the exclude option, you can exclude classes from being monitored by Dynatrace. See [Dynatrace Agent Framework](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/ibm-websphere-liberty-buildpack/blob/master/docs/framework-dynatrace_one_agent.md){: external} for more details about configuring the user-provided service.

3. After you push your app to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, bind the user-provided service that you created to the app. For example, use the following command:
 
    ```text
    ibmcloud cf bs myApp my-dynatrace-collector
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Note:** You must restage your app after binding the service.

## Optional configuration
{: #optional_configuration}

You may choose to acquire and host the Dynatrace agent `.jar` file yourself.  In that case the following additional configuration steps are needed.
1. Acquire and host the Dynatrace agent `.jar` file so that the Liberty buildpack can download it.
2. Configure your Liberty app so that it can download the Dynatrace agent.

### Hosting the Dynatrace agent
{: #hosting_dynatrace_agent}

The Dynatrace agent must be hosted on a web server, and the Liberty buildpack must be able to download the agent `.jar` file from that server. The server must be configured with an `index.yml` file that specifies details about the agent `.jar` file. Complete the steps that follow to set up the Dynatrace agent:
1. Download the Dynatrace agent `.jar` file. See [Dynatrace Server Platform Installers](https://community.dynatrace.com/community/display/EVAL/Step+1+-+Download+and+install+Dynatrace){: external} at the Dynatrace community website for instructions on downloading the Dynatrace agent `.jar` file. The appropriate agent `.jar` file for running on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is the `dynatrace-agent-unix.jar` version `6.+`.
2. Host the agent `.jar` file in a location from which the Liberty buildpack can download it. You can host it on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} itself using any of the available server facilities, or you can host it on some publicly available location.
    
    * Ensure that you provide a `index.yml` file at the hosting location. The `index.yml` file must contain an entry consisting of the version ID of the agent `.jar` file follow by a colon and the complete URL of the location of that agent `.jar` file. For example:

        ```text
        6.3.0: https://my-dynatrace-agent.mybluemix.net/dynatrace-agent-6.3.0-unix.jar
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    * The `dynatrace-agent-6.3.0-unix.jar` file must be available at the location specified in the `index.yml` file. The location for both the `.jar` file and the `index.yml` can be the same directory.

### Configuring the Liberty app
{: #configuring_liberty_app}

The Liberty app you want to monitor must be configured to locate the server hosting the agent `.jar` file you previously set up. You can configure the app with the **JBP_CONFIG_DYNATRACEAPPMONAGENT** environment variable. The **JBP_CONFIG_DYNATRACEAPPMONAGENT** environment variable tells the buildpack where to download the Dynatrace agent from. To set the environment variable, complete these steps:

1. Set the variable **JBP_CONFIG_DYNATRACEAPPMONAGENT** so it has the value *"repository_root: URL_of_server_hosting_index.yml"*. For example, after pushing your app issue the following command:

    ```text
    ibmcloud cf se myApp JBP_CONFIG_DYNATRACEAPPMONAGENT 'repository_root: https://my-dynatrace-agent-host.mybluemix.net'
    ```
    {: pre}

    In this example, `my-dynatrace-agent-host.mybluemix.net` is the URL of the `index.yml` file hosted by the server that you previously configured.

2. After you set the environment variable, restage your app. Check the staging log for a message indicating successful download of the Dynatrace agent from your agent hosting server. For example:

    ```text
    Downloading dynatrace-agent-6.3.0-unix.jar 6.3.0 from https://my-dynatrace-agent-host.mybluemix.net/dynatrace-agent-6.3.0-unix.jar (17.8s)
    ```
