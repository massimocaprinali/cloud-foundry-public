# Enforce HTTPS on all pages in your app
{: #nodejs-enforce_https}

{{site.data.keyword.ibmcf_full}} is deprecated. As of 30 November 2022 new {{site.data.keyword.ibmcf_full}} applications cannot be created and only existing users will be able to deploy applications. End-of-support happens on 1 June 2023. Any instances that still exist on 1 June 2023 will be deleted. For more information, see [the deprecation details](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-deprecation).
{: deprecated}

When you run your app in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} with the express framework, the following changes need to be made to enforce HTTPS instead of HTTP on all pages in your app.

```text
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

app.enable('trust proxy');

app.use (function (req, res, next) {
  if (req.secure || process.env.BLUEMIX_REGION === undefined) {
    next();
  } else {
    console.log('redirecting to https');
    res.redirect('https://' + req.headers.host + req.url);
  }
});
```
