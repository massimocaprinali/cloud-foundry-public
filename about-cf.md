# What is Cloud Foundry?
{: #what-is-cloud-foundry}

[Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/){: external} is the premier industry standard Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that ensures the fastest, easiest, and most reliable deployment of cloud-native apps. Cloud Foundry ensures that the build and deploy aspects of coding remain carefully coordinated with any attached services; resulting in quick, consistent, and reliable iterating of apps.

## Benefits of Cloud Foundry
{: #key-benefits-of-cloud-foundry}

**Choose your own language** - {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Foundry includes runtimes for Java&trade;, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Swift, and Go.  Cloud Foundry community build packs are also available. Combined with DevOps services, the app runtimes enable a delivery pipeline that automates much of the iterative development process.

**Fault tolerant** - Runtimes facilitate developing apps as stateless processes that quickly: start and stop, replicate if an instance fails, and duplicate if sustained or increased performance requires.

**Extend apps with services** - Runtimes link {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services to apps as endpoints, giving any instance of an app embedded knowledge of how to manage relevant calls and data. In fact, runtimes manage all linked resources this way: SDKs, APIs (whether made available as cloud services or exposed from within a traditional enterprise as custom services), and also apps themselves when used as resources by other apps.

**Access control** - Fine grain assignment/dispensing of compute capacity to development teams.

**Automatic placement** - Apps are automatically placed across multiple data-center PODs for maximum reliability.

**Automatic health management** - Crashing apps restart automatically.

**Automatic routing** - Internet reachable routes are automatically created for your apps.

**High availability** - Supports full high availability for high app availability.

**Automatic deployment scaling** - The Auto-Scaling for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service automatically increases or decreases the compute capacity of your app, to rapidly adjust to dynamic loading needs.
