# Node.js buildpacks

{{site.data.keyword.ibmcf_full}} is deprecated. As of 30 November 2022 new {{site.data.keyword.ibmcf_full}} applications cannot be created and only existing users will be able to deploy applications. End-of-support happens on 1 June 2023. Any instances that still exist on 1 June 2023 will be deleted. For more information, see [the deprecation details](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-deprecation).
{: deprecated}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} provides multiple versions of the Node.js buildpack.
{: shortdesc}

* The {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} created **sdk-for-nodejs** buildpack is the default buildpack used for Node.js apps in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
* The **nodejs_buildpack** is a community buildpack provided by the Cloud Foundry community.

The **sdk-for-nodejs** buildpack takes precedence over the **nodejs_buildpack** in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. If you want to use the **nodejs_buildpack** with your app instead of the **sdk-for-nodejs** buildpack, you must specify your buildpack, for example, by using the `-b` option with the `ibmcloud cf push` command.

Typically the current **sdk-for-nodejs** buildpack and a previous version are available.  To see all the available buildpacks us the `ibmcloud cf buildpacks` command.
