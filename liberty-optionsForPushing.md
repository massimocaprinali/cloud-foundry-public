# Options for pushing Liberty apps
{: #options_for_pushing}

The behavior of the Liberty server in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} is controlled by the Liberty buildpack. Buildpacks can provide a complete runtime environment for a specific class of apps. They are key to providing portability across clouds and contributing to an open cloud architecture. The Liberty buildpack provides WebSphere Liberty container capable of running Jakarta EE, Eclipse MicroProfile, Java EE, and OSGi apps. It supports popular frameworks such as Spring and includes the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} JRE. WebSphere Liberty enables rapid app development that is suited to the cloud. The Liberty buildpack supports multiple apps that are deployed into a single Liberty server. As part of the Liberty buildpack integration into {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, the buildpack ensures that environment variables for binding services are shown as configuration variables in the Liberty server.


You can use the following methods to deploy your Liberty apps to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

* Pushing a stand-alone app
* Pushing a server directory
* Pushing a packaged server

Important: When you deploy an app with the Liberty buildpack, specify a minimum of 512M as the memory limit for your apps. For more information, see [Memory limits and the Liberty buildpack](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-memory_limits).

## Stand-alone apps
{: #stand_alone_apps}

Stand-alone apps such as WAR or EAR files can be deployed to Liberty in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

To deploy a stand-alone app, run the `ibmcloud cf push` command with the -p option that points to your WAR or EAR file.
For example:

```text
ibmcloud cf push <yourappname> -p myapp.war
```
{: pre}

When a stand-alone app is deployed, a default Liberty configuration is provided for the app. The default configuration enables the following Liberty features:

* `beanValidation-1.1`
* [`cdi-1.2`](#cdi12)
* `ejbLite-3.2`
* `el-3.0`
* `jaxrs-2.0`
* `jdbc-4.1`
* `jndi-1.0`
* `jpa-2.1`
* `jsf-2.2`
* `jsonp-1.0`
* `jsp-2.3`
* `managedBeans-1.0`
* `servlet-3.1`
* `websocket-1.1`
* `icap:managementConnector-1.0`
* `appstate-2.0`

These features correspond to the Java EE 7 Web Profile features. You can specify a different set of Liberty features by setting the `JBP_CONFIG_LIBERTY` environment variable. For example, to enable only the `jsp-2.3` and `websocket-1.1` features, run the command and restage the app:

```text
ibmcloud cf set-env myapp JBP_CONFIG_LIBERTY "app_archive: {features: [jsp-2.3, websocket-1.1]}"
```
{: pre}

For best results, set the Liberty features with the `JBP_CONFIG_LIBERTY` environment variable or deploy your app as a [server directory](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-options_for_pushing#server_directory) or [packaged server](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-options_for_pushing#packaged_server) with a custom `server.xml` file. Setting this environment variable ensures that your app uses only the feature that it needs and it is not affected by the buildpack's default Liberty feature set changes. If you need to provide extra Liberty configuration beyond the feature set, use the [server directory](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-options_for_pushing#server_directory) or the [packaged server](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-options_for_pushing#packaged_server) option to deploy your app.
{: note}

If you deployed a WAR file, the web app is accessible under the context root as set in the embedded `ibm-web-ext.xml` file. If the `ibm-web-ext.xml` file does not exist, or does not specify the context root, the app is accessible under the root context. For example,

```text
http://<yourappname>.mybluemix.net/
```
{: codeblock}

If you deployed an EAR file, the embedded web app is accessible under the context root as defined in the EAR deployment descriptor. For example,

```text
http://<yourappname>.mybluemix.net/acme/
```
{: codeblock}

The entire default Liberty `server.xml` configuration file is as follows:

```text
    <server>
       <featureManager>
          <feature>beanValidation-1.1</feature>
          <feature>cdi-1.2</feature>
          <feature>ejbLite-3.2</feature>
          <feature>el-3.0</feature>
          <feature>jaxrs-2.0</feature>
          <feature>jdbc-4.1</feature>
          <feature>jndi-1.0</feature>
          <feature>jpa-2.1</feature>
          <feature>jsf-2.2</feature>
          <feature>jsonp-1.0</feature>
          <feature>jsp-2.3</feature>
          <feature>managedBeans-1.0</feature>
          <feature>servlet-3.1</feature>
          <feature>websocket-1.1</feature>
          <feature>icap:managementConnector-1.0</feature>
          <feature>appstate-2.0</feature>
       </featureManager>

       <application name='myapp' location='myapp.war' type='war' context-root='/'/>
       <httpEndpoint id='defaultHttpEndpoint' host='*' httpPort='${port}'/>
       <webContainer trustHostHeaderPort='true' extractHostHeaderPort='true'/>
       <include location='runtime-vars.xml'/>
       <logging logDirectory='${application.log.dir}' consoleLogLevel='INFO'/>
       <httpDispatcher enableWelcomePage='false'/>
       <applicationMonitor dropinsEnabled='false' updateTrigger='mbean'/>
       <config updateTrigger='mbean'/>
       <cdi12 enableImplicitBeanArchives='false'/>
       <appstate2 appName='myapp'/>
    </server>
```
{: codeblock}

### Java Main (for jars with a main() class)
{: #java_main}

Java apps, including Spring Boot apps, that contain a class with a main() method are executed using `java -jar`.  Liberty's native Spring Boot support can be enabled using the `LIBERTY_NATIVE_SPRINGBOOT` environment variable.

For example, to use Liberty's `springBoot-2.0` feature:

```text
ibmcloud cf set-env myapp LIBERTY_NATIVE_SPRINGBOOT 2.0
```

The Liberty server is used to run the app if the `LIBERTY_NATIVE_SPRINGBOOT` environment variable is set to a valid Liberty `springBoot` feature version.


### CDI 1.2
{: #cdi12}

For performance reasons, when deploying WAR and EAR files only, the [CDI 1.2 implicit bean archives scanning](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/cwlp_cdi_behavior.html){: external} is disabled by default. Implicit bean archive scanning can be enabled using the `JBP_CONFIG_LIBERTY` environment variable.

For example:

```text
ibmcloud cf set-env myapp JBP_CONFIG_LIBERTY "app_archive: { implicit_cdi: true }"
```    
{: pre}

Important: In order for your environment variable changes to take effect you must restage your app:

```text
ibmcloud cf restage myapp
```
{: pre}

## Server directory
{: #server_directory}

In some cases, it might be necessary to provide a custom Liberty server configuration with your app. This custom configuration might be needed when you deploy a WAR or EAR file and the default `server.xml` file does not have the certain settings that your app needs.

If you installed the Liberty profile on your workstation and you already created a Liberty server with your app, you can push the contents of that directory to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
For example, if your Liberty server is named `defaultServer`, run the command:

```text
ibmcloud cf push <yourappname> -p wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer
```
{: pre}

If a Liberty profile is not installed on your workstation, you can use the following steps to create a server directory with your app:

1. Create a directory that is named `defaultServer`.
2. Create an apps directory in the `defaultServer` directory.
3. Copy your WAR or EAR file into the `defaultServer/apps` directory.
4. In the `defaultServer` directory, create a `server.xml` file with the example content that follows.  In addition:
    * Make sure to update the location or the type attribute of the app element to match the file name and the type of your app.
    * The `server.xml` file in the diagram shows a minimal feature set. You might have to adjust the feature set depending on your app's needs.

    ```text
    <server>
        <featureManager>
            <feature>jsp-2.3</feature>
        </featureManager>

        <httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint" host="*" httpPort="8080" />

        <application name="myapp" context-root="/" type="war" location="myapp.war"/>
    </server>
    ```
    {: codeblock}

After the server directory is ready, you can deploy it to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

```text
ibmcloud cf push <yourappname> -p defaultServer
```
{: pre}

The web apps that are deployed as part of the server directory are accessible under the [context root, as determined by the Liberty profile](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/twlp_dep_war.html?cp=SSAW57_8.5.5){: external}. For example:

```text
http://<yourappname>.mybluemix.net/acme/
```
{: codeblock}

## Packaged server
{: #packaged_server}

You can also push a packaged server file to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. The packaged server file is created by using Liberty's server package command. In addition to the app and configuration files, the packaged server file can contain shared resources and Liberty user features needed by the app.

To package a Liberty server, use the `./bin/server package` command from your Liberty installation directory. Specify your server name and include the `--include=usr` option.
For example, if your Liberty server is `defaultServer`, run the command:

```text
wlp/bin/server package defaultServer --include=usr
```
{: pre}

This command generates a `serverName.zip` file in the server's directory. If you used the `--archive` option to specify a different archive file, make sure it has the `.zip` extension instead of `.jar`. **The buildpack does not support packaged server files created with the `.jar` extension**.

You can then push the generated `.zip` file to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} with the `ibmcloud cf push` command.

For example:

```text
ibmcloud cf push <yourappname> -p wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/defaultServer.zip
```
{: pre}

The web apps that are deployed as part of the packaged server are accessible under the context root, as determined by the Liberty profile.
{: note}

### Modification of the `server.xml` file
{: #modifications_of_serverxml}

When a packaged server or a Liberty server directory is pushed, the Liberty buildpack detects the `server.xml` file along with your app. The Liberty buildpack makes the following modifications to the `server.xml` file.

* The buildpack ensures that there is exactly one `httpEndpoint` element in the file.
* The buildpack ensures that the `httpPort` attribute in the `httpEndpoint` element points to a system variable that is called ${port}. The buildpack also overrides the host attribute.
* The buildpack sets the `logDirectory` attribute in the logging element to point to a system log directory.
* The buildpack ensures that a `runtime-vars.xml` file is logically merged with your `server.xml` file. Specifically, the buildpack appends the line `<include location="runtime-vars.xml" />` to your `server.xml` file.

### Variables that can be referenced
{: #referenceable_variables}

The following variables are defined in the `runtime-vars.xml` file, and referenced from a pushed `server.xml` file. All the variables are case-sensitive.

* ${port}: The HTTP port that the Liberty server is listening on.
* ${vcap_app_port}: Same as ${port}. Not set when running on Diego.
* ${application_name}: The name of the app, as defined by using the options in the `ibmcloud cf push` command.
* ${application_version}: The version of this instance of the app, which takes the form of a UUID, such as `b687ea75-49f0-456e-b69d-e36e8a854caa`. This variable changes with each successive push of the app that contains new code or changes to the app artifacts.
* ${host}: The IP address of the app instance.
* ${application_uris}: A JSON-style array of the endpoints that can be used to access this app, for example: `myapp.mydomain.com`.
* ${start}: The time and date that the app was started, taking a form similar to `2013-08-22 10:10:18 -0400`. Not set when running on Diego.

### Accessing information of bound services
{: #accessing_info_of_bound_services}

When you want to bind a service to your app, information about the service, such as connection credentials, is included in the [VCAP_SERVICES environment variable](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES){: external} that Cloud Foundry sets for the app. For [automatically configured services](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-auto_config), the Liberty buildpack generates or updates service binding entries in the `server.xml` file. The contents of the service binding entries can be in one of the following forms:

* cloud.services.&lt;service-name&gt;.&lt;property&gt;, which describes the information such as the name, type, and plan of the service.
* cloud.services.&lt;service-name&gt;.connection.&lt;property&gt;, which describes the connection information for the service.

The typical set of information is as follows:
* name: The name of the service, for example, `mysql-e3abd`.
* label: The type of the created service, for example, `mysql-5.5`.
* plan: The service plan, as indicated by the unique identifier for that plan, for example, 100.
* connection.name: A unique identifier for the connection, which takes the form of a UUID, for example, d01af3a5fabeb4d45bb321fe114d652ee.
* connection.hostname: The host name of the server that is running the service, for example, `mysql-server.mydomain.com`.
* connection.host: The IP address of the server that is running the service, for example, 9.37.193.2.
* connection.port: The port on which the service is listening for incoming connections, for example, 3306,3307.
* connection.user: The user name that is used to authenticate this app to the service. The user name is auto-generated by Cloud Foundry, for example, unHwANpjAG5wT.
* connection.username: An alias for connection.user.
* connection.password: The password that is used to authenticate this app to the service. The password is auto-generated by Cloud Foundry, for example, pvyCY0YzX9pu5.

For bound services that are not automatically configured by the Liberty buildpack, the app needs to manage the access of the backend resource on its own.
