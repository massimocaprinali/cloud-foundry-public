# Use custom native libraries
{: #use_customlib}

Some libraries might require you to use both a NuGet package and some native library files (`.so` files).  

To use these libraries with the buildpack, place them in a `ld_library_path` folder within the root folder of your app. The buildpack automatically adds this path to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable during staging.  

Alternatively, you can specify the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable in your app's `manifest.yml` file or by using the `ibmcloud cf set-env` command to use a different folder name than `ld_library_path`.  In this case, the buildpack appends this custom path to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` generated by the buildpack.
